### That Dirty Bug
<br>
“Oh not again this dumb console”

Countless times this had been said<br>
Never put yourself in the console's shoe?

<br>



<br>
We all complain about this dumb bug
</br>
That stays like a rusty rug

With hopes of a small dog<br>
And feelings of a dirty mug

<br>
Without a console, we all won’t be here

All the debuggers will be fired<br>
All the ardent will give up<br>
And all the professionals will quit
</br>

<br>
Without the console

We will be searching and searching<br>
The search through millions of lines of code <br>
To find the missing semicolon.
</br>

<br>
The wasted time will truly be tremendous

We all will miss the monthly updates<br>
Because they will be no more.
</br>
<br>

Without the console…
<br>It would be the end of the world</br>
